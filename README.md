Hello! This is a repository to track all my activities from Test Automation University (TAU) course - Introduction to Pytest

All notes and files are organized in the folders inside /tests named with each Chapter of the course.

To run the tests, you need to have PIP and Python 3 installed and run:

`python -m pytest`
